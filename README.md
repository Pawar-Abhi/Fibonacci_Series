# Fibonacci_Series
The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers (the Fibonacci numbers) that starts with a zero, followed by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers. The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with the following 14 integers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ...
